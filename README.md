# Quantum-Computing-Libs

To start working with the Quantum Computing Library Toolkit, first copy the 'QCLibs' folder to the project folder and then just type the following line in your C/C++ program:-

#include "QCLibs/QCLibs.h"

This should include all the functionalities for defining Qubits and doing various Operations on them!

Also see the 'Examples' folder to know more about the functionality. The 'Examples' folder contains various examples like:-

1. CNOT Gate
2. Hadamard Gate
3. Rotation of qubits about X, Y, Z - Axes of Bloch Sphere
4. Quantum NOT Gate
5. Quantum Registers
6. Quantum Rotation about imaginary axis
7. Quantum swapping of two Qubits

and more on the way!

Enjoy! :)
