# Quantum-Computing-Libs

To start working with the Quantum Computing Toolkit, first copy the 'QCLibs' folder to the project folder and then just type the following line in your C/C++ program:-

#include "QCLibs.h"

This should include all the functionalities for defining Qubits and doing various Operations on them!

Enjoy! :)
